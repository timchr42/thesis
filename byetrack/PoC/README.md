# Capabilities against Tracking (HyTrack) - Proof-Of-Concept

- This repository contains the modified components and additions required to build a capability-based framework that mitigates cross-app tracking via HyTrack.
- It includes changes to the Installer, Browser, and a sample App, along with the implementation of the Capabilities mechanism itself.
- This setup was used to produce the demo video showcasing the mitigation in action.

The same setup steps were used as outlined by the authors of HyTrack. For reference see `README_setup.md`.
