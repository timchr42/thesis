Title: Capabilities as a Solution against Tracking Across Android Apps
Research Area: RA5 
Abstract: Trusted Web Activities and Custom Tabs enable Android developers to seamlessly
integrate web content into native applications, offering a powerful tool for features
such as Single Sign-On and in-app monetization. However, as shown by HyTrack, this
integration also introduces severe privacy risks by blurring the boundary between web and
app contexts, allowing persistent tracking through the browser’s shared cookie storage.
In this work, we propose a novel mitigation framework that applies capability-based
access control to browser cookie handling. Cookie access is encapsulated in fine-grained,
identity-bound capabilities, ensuring that only trusted first-party or explicitly authorized
third-party web servers – defined by a developer-controlled policy – can access the
shared browser state. All other untrusted third-party servers are confined to isolated,
in-app cookie jars. This empowers well-meaning developers to continue leveraging third-
party libraries while preventing them from performing unauthorized cross-app tracking.
At the same time, essential features such as Single Sign-On and personalized content
delivery remain fully functional. Our approach balances privacy and usability, allowing
tracking-resistant web-app integration without degrading the user experience.
