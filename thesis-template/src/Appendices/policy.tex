  "predefined": {
    "global": {
      "royaleapi.com": ["__royaleapi_session_v2", "another_cookie"]
    },
    "private": {
      "schnellnochraviolimachen.de": ["named_cookie"],
      "royaleapi.com": ["__royaleapi_session_v2"]

  }
}
\end{verbatim}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textit{royaleapi.com} only receives a predefined private and a global wildcard token (for general cookie usage).
    This is because the identical cookie \textit{\_\_royaleapi\_session\_v2} of the same domain is registered to receive a token for both isolation scopes.
    The token generator therefore downgrades the token to the private one, as it is more restrictive.

  \item \textit{schnellnochraviolimachen.de} receives a private predefined token limited to one cookie.

  \item \textit{nr-data.net} receives a private wildcard token, granting limited cookie handling rights without predefined cookie names.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Downgrading Policy Example}
Here, the predefined rule downgrades the predefined global access of \textit{\_\_royaleapi\_session\_v2} to the private predefined entry. 
Cross Conflicts on the other hand are ignored. 
The wildcard rule allows all cookies on the same domain to global storage, except the predefined one.
Both entries are kept during downgrade.
