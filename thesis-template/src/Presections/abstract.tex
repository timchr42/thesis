% What's the problem?
Trusted Web Activities and Custom Tabs enable Android developers to seamlessly integrate web content into native applications, offering a powerful tool for features such as Single Sign-On and in-app monetization.
However, as demonstrated by HyTrack, this integration also introduces severe privacy risks by blurring the boundary between web and app contexts, allowing persistent tracking through the browser's shared cookie storage.
% How it has been handled/solved/measured?
In this work, we propose Byetrack, a novel mitigation framework that applies capability-based access control to browser cookie handling.
Cookie access is encapsulated in fine-grained, identity-bound capabilities, ensuring that only trusted first-party or explicitly authorized third-party web servers -- defined by a developer-controlled policy -- can access the shared browser state.
All other untrusted third-party domains are confined to isolated, in-app cookie jars.
This empowers well-meaning developers to continue leveraging third-party libraries while preventing them from performing unauthorized cross-app tracking.
At the same time, essential features such as Single Sign-On and personalized content delivery remain fully functional.
Our approach thus balances privacy and usability, allowing tracking-resistant web-app integration without degrading the user experience.
