% What's the problem?
Trusted Web Activities and Custom Tabs enable Android developers to seamlessly integrate web content into native applications, offering a powerful tool for features such as Single Sign-On and in-app monetization.
However, as demonstrated by HyTrack, this integration also introduces severe privacy risks by blurring the boundary between web and app contexts, allowing persistent tracking through the browser's shared cookie storage.

% How it has been handled/solved/measured?
In this work, we propose Byetrack, a novel mitigation framework that applies capability-based access control to browser cookie handling.
Cookie access is encapsulated in fine-grained, identity-bound capabilities, ensuring that only trusted first-party or explicitly authorized third-party web servers -- defined by a developer-controlled policy -- can access the shared browser state.
All other untrusted third-party domains are confined to isolated, app-local cookie jars.
Importantly, these isolated cookie jars are not only used internally to confine untrusted domains but are also exposed as a stable, developer-usable storage mechanism for domains that are intentionally scoped to the application.

Byetrack is designed to be fully backwards compatible with legacy applications: apps that do not provide a policy automatically retain the standard CT/TWA behavior without requiring any modifications.
At the same time, developers who opt in gain precise control over how cookie state is shared across the app–web boundary, enabling improved privacy guarantees without requiring changes to existing web content.
Our approach thus balances privacy and usability, enabling tracking-resistant web–app integration while preserving essential features such as Single Sign-On, personalized content delivery, and compatibility with existing Android applications.
