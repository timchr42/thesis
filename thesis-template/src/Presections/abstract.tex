% What's the problem?
Trusted Web Activities and Custom Tabs enable Android developers to seamlessly integrate web content into native applications, offering a powerful tool for features such as Single Sign-On and in-app monetization.
However, as shown by HyTrack, this integration also introduces severe privacy risks by blurring the boundary between web and app contexts, allowing persistent cross-app tracking through the browser’s shared cookie storage.

% How it has been handled/solved/measured?
In this work, we propose a novel mitigation framework that applies capability-based access control to browser cookie handling.
Cookie access is encapsulated in fine-grained, identity-bound capabilities, ensuring that only trusted first-party or explicitly authorized third-party web servers—defined by a developer-controlled policy—can access the shared browser state.
All other untrusted third-party servers are confined to isolated, in-app cookie jars.
This empowers developers to continue leveraging third-party libraries while preventing them from performing unauthorized cross-app tracking.
At the same time, essential features such as Single Sign-On and personalized content delivery remain fully functional.
Our approach strikes a deliberate balance between privacy and usability, enabling secure web-app integration regarding tracking without compromising user experience or developer effort.
