I would like to thank Noah Mauthe for supervising this thesis and for his continuous guidance and support.
His constructive feedback and our many discussions were invaluable in shaping the ideas and implementation in this work.

I also thank Dr. Sven Bugiel for giving me the opportunity to carry out this thesis in his group and for his helpful input throughout the project.
