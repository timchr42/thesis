I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Noah Mauthe for supervising this thesis and for his continuous guidance, support, and technical insight.
His willingness to help, his clear and constructive feedback, and the many discussions we had were essential for shaping both the ideas and the implementation presented in this work.
I am deeply thankful for his commitment throughout the entire project.

I would also like to thank Dr. Sven Bugiel for giving me the opportunity to conduct this thesis in his group and for his valuable input and encouragement during the project.
