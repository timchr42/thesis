% ----------------------------Methodology--------------------------

Our evaluation is guided by the following hypotheses:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{H1}: Our framework prevents unauthorized cookie reuse across applications using the same tracking domain (i.e., blocks HyTrack-style tracking).
  \item \textbf{H2}: It does not break legitimate web interactions within a single app, including login flows and session persistence.
  \item \textbf{H3}: It preserves the seamless user experience expected from CTs and TWAs.
\end{itemize}
