\section{Hypotheses}

My evaluation is guided by the following hypotheses:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{H1}: The framework prevents a hytrack deployed third-party library from tracking users across different apps.
  \item \textbf{H2}: It does not break legitimate web interactions within a single app, including login flows and session persistence.
  \item \textbf{H3}: It preserves the seamless user experience expected from CTs and TWAs.
    \\ \vdots
  \item \textbf{Hx}: \dots
\end{itemize}
