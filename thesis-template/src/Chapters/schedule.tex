% A schedule with verifiable milestones to be reached on a specified date.
% State potential risks for the proposal and their impact, as well as how to mitigate them, including alternatives

% -----------------------------Schedule---------------------------

I plan to complete the project in the following phases:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Phase 1 (Weeks a-b):} \textit{Background Research and Literature Review} \\
  Study existing work on web and cross-app tracking, especially the HyTrack paper.
  Familiarize with Android's Custom Tabs (CTs), Trusted Web Activities (TWAs), and Chromium’s cookie storage mechanisms.
  Reproduce the HyTrack proof of concept to establish a baseline for evaluation.

  \item \textbf{Phase 2 (Weeks c-d):} \textit{Framework Design and Initial Implementation} \\
  Design the capability-based access control framework.
  Define requirements, threat model, and integration points. \info{same threat model, how to integrate not sure yet}
  Begin implementation of a prototype mitigation layer in an Android environment.

  \item \textbf{Phase 3 (Weeks e-f):} \textit{Evaluation and Experimentation} \\
  Set up experimental infrastructure using HyTrack’s open-source tooling.
  Measure the effectiveness of the proposed solution by replicating tracking scenarios and comparing cookie behaviors across test cases.

  \item \textbf{Phase 4 (Weeks g-h):} \textit{Analysis and Refinement} \\
  Analyze experiment results.
  Identify any shortcomings and refine the framework.
  Evaluate performance and integration feasibility.
  Summarize findings in preparation for documentation.    

  \item \textbf{Phase 5 (\dots):} \textit{Thesis Writing and Finalization} \\
  Write the thesis document, including all sections: introduction, background, methodology, evaluation, and discussion. Prepare for final presentation and submission.

  \item \textbf{Phase x (Weeks \dots):} \textit{\dots} \\

\end{itemize}

\section{Risks, Impact and Mitigation}
At worst, the (capability-based)\unsure{wait for Mauthe Feedback} approach may not effectively prevent cross-app tracking in practice and indeed a complete redesign of the Custom Tab and Trusted Web Activity API is needed-as suggested by the authors of HyTrack.
If this occurs, the thesis will pivot to a critical analysis of why the capability model falls short in this context.
The focus will shift towards identifying structural barriers in the Android platform and recommending future improvements, such as \dots. \change{figure this out}.

At much lower impact, the implementation may not be feasible within the given timeframe or due to unforseen technical challenges.
In this case, development will focus on a minimal viable proof-of-concept that demonstrates core functionality and missing features will be discussed as future work.
