\chapter{Schedule}

\todo[inline]{Write the schedule. Something like this?}

% A schedule with verifiable milestones to be reached on a specified date.
% State potential risks for the proposal and their impact, as well as how to mitigate them, including alternatives

% -----------------------------Schedule---------------------------

I plan to complete the project in the following phases:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Phase 1 (Weeks a-b):} Literature review and background research on cross-app tracking and existing mitigation strategies.
  \item \textbf{Phase 2 (Weeks c-d):} Design and implement the proposed mitigation framework \dots
  \item \textbf{Phase 3 (Weeks e-f):} Conduct experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of the framework against HyTrack.
  \item \textbf{Phase 4 (Weeks g-h):} Analyze results, refine the framework based on findings, and \dots
  \item \textbf{Phase x (\dots):} \dots
\end{itemize}

\todo[inline]{State potential risks and how to mitigate them.}

At worst, I might come to the conclusion that my approach does not work and indeed, a completely redesign of the Custom Tab and Trusted Web Activity API is needed to prevent cross-app tracking deployed by HyTrack.
In this case, I will have to adjust my thesis accordingly and focus on the aspects why the fine grained nature of capabilities/tokens fails and is not sufficient to prevent such tracking.
Subsequently, I try to work out aspects what could and has to be done to allow for an easier solution to the problem. \change{clean this up!!!}

In case I run out of time or struggle with the implementation, I will focus on the most important aspects of the framework and provide a proof of concept that demonstrates the core functionality.
