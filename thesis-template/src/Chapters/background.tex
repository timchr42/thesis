\chapter{Background}

% Provide the necessary technical and conceptual background:

% - Overview of Custom Tabs (CTs), Trusted Web Activities (TWAs), and browser cookie sharing on Android.

% - Explain HyTrack in more detail (summarize its attack flow, key findings, and impact) — this links to your implementation context.

% - Introduce capability-based access control and JWTs as foundational ideas.

% - Optionally, include related mitigations (e.g., CHIPS, Total Cookie Protection).
% - Introduce Capabilities/Tokens?

\section{Custom Tabs and Trusted Web Activities on Android}
%Overview of CTs, TWAs

Custom Tabs (CTs) and Trusted Web Activities (TWAs) enable a seamless integration between apps and the web by sharing browser state -- most notably, session cookies.
While this enhances user experience, it also introduces a significant privacy risk: third-party libraries can exploit the shared browser state to track users across multiple apps in which they are embedded.
For instance, HyTrack demonstrates that a single shared third-party library used across multiple apps is sufficient to persistently identify and track users, bypassing conventional browser and OS sandboxing mechanisms.

\section{HyTrack Attack Overview}
summarize its attack flow (with figure describing Hytrack?), key findings, and impact. Or should this go into its own chapter?
