% Summarize the achieved goals, contributions, and what the results imply for Android privacy.

Android's Custom Tabs and Trusted Web Activities enable seamless integration of web content into Android applications while leveraging browser features such as cookies, storage, and Single Sign-On. 
Although this enhances user experience, the shared browser state introduces privacy risks, as demonstrated by Wessel et~al.~\cite{USENIX:Wessels:2025} through the HyTrack attack, which enables persistent cross-app tracking across Android apps and the web.

This thesis presents Byetrack, a capability-based framework designed to mitigate such cross-app tracking attacks by introducing policy-based, per-application control over shared browser state.
Application developers can define fine-grained policies that specify which domains are trusted to access shared browser data.
During installation, the framework automatically generates cryptographically bound capability tokens for each application, which the browser verifies and enforces at runtime.
Through this mechanism, Byetrack isolates cookies and related identifiers according to developer-defined trust boundaries, effectively limiting cross-app information leakage without breaking legitimate functionality.

Byetrack extends the AndroidX Browser Library and Firefox for Android to integrate policy enforcement directly into the Custom Tabs and Trusted Web Activity workflows.
Developers can further benefit by designating first-party cookies as private or by predefining specific trusted cookie names, allowing precise control over shared browser state.
Experimental evaluation confirmed that the framework prevents unauthorized cookie sharing between apps while preserving compatibility with intended Single Sign-On scenarios.

In summary, this work demonstrates that capability-based access control provides a practical and effective foundation for mitigating cross-app tracking through shared browser state on Android. 
Byetrack shows that stronger privacy guarantees can coexist with usability and interoperability, marking a step toward a more privacy-conscious mobile web ecosystem.
